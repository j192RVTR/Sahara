# Sahara

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

## Project Description

### Sahara

Sahara is an e-commerce website where registered users may select from a wide range of products to purchase. Customers will also be able to navigate the different categories of products on the app. In addition, customers will be able to view prices from ascending to descending prices and vice-versa. Customers will also be able to add and remove products from their shopping cart as desired. This will consist of coding via Angular and Spring MVC. With Angular, we plan to utilize bootstrap, CSS, and HTML. The Java Spring MVC will consist of using Hibernate, JDBC, and Spring CORE. Additionally, the project will feature a Rest API.
